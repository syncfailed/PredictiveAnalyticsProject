Programming Requirements
- Begin with a train/test split. Use the test set for final evaluation only.
- Train your model using the training data only.
- Apply transformations as needed:
	- Impute missing values (or drop them)
	- Encode and scale your data
	- Select a representative subset of predictor variables
- Tune model parameters and hyperparameters using cross-validation
- Evaluate your model with data in the test set. Present metrics which quantify the predictive power of your model.
- Write clean code with clear comments. Your code will need to be submitted with your PowerPoint presentation on the last day of class. 
- Code should run cleanly from start to finish, not a haphazard arrangement of fragments whose order of execution is not clear.

Presentation Requirements
- You will present a PowerPoint presentation describing your model on the last day of class, November 8.
- Present as if to a team of non-technical business leaders
	- Do not include Python code in the presentation. That will be submitted to me separately.
	- Use technical terms sparingly and define them briefly when you use them.
- Your presentation should include the following:
	- Summary of the problem being addressed (cite your data source)
	- Descriptive statistics or graphics revealing insights into the nature of the data used in the model
	- A baseline model which is easy for a non-technical audience to understand
	- A strategy for improving predictive power beyond the capabilities of the baseline model
	- Final model evaluation with metrics presented with non-technical explanations
- Duration: 12 to 15 mins
- Number of slides: 4 to 8.
