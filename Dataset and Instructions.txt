Requirements
- Begin with a train/test split. Use the test set for final evaluation only.
- Train your model using the training data only.
- Have a baseline 
- Apply transformations as needed:
	- Impute missing values (or drop them)
	- Encode and scale your data
	- Select a representative subset of predictor variables
- Tune model parameters and hyperparameters using cross-validation
- Evaluate your model with data in the test set. Present metrics which quantify the predictive power of your model.
- Write clean code with clear comments.
- Ensure the cells are run in a straight order (top to bottom).

Presentation Requirements
- Your presentation should include the following:
	- Summary of the problem being addressed (cite your data source)
	- Descriptive statistics or graphics revealing insights into the nature of the data used in the model
	- A baseline model which is easy for a non-technical audience to understand
	- A strategy for improving predictive power beyond the capabilities of the baseline model
	- Final model evaluation with metrics presented with non-technical explanations
- Duration: 12 to 15 mins
- Number of slides: 4 to 8.
